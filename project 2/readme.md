In creating the Memory Match Game, I focused on building a solid foundation and enhancing the overall user experience. The key changes include setting up the basic HTML structure, styling the interface using CSS for a responsive layout, and implementing the game logic with JavaScript. I created an intuitive landing page with buttons for selecting different categories (Fruits, Emojis, Animals, Planets) and ensured the game grid dynamically adjusts based on the chosen category. Cards are shuffled randomly, and players can flip them to find matching pairs. The game tracks the player's score and includes a 30-second countdown timer, displaying a "Game Over" message when time runs out.

To further enhance the game, I added features like a new category (Flags of Countries or Famous Landmarks) and made sure the game works seamlessly across different devices by applying responsive design principles. Additionally, the game includes sound effects for various actions, saving game state to local storage, and smooth animations for better visual feedback. These improvements create a more engaging and interactive experience for users, making the Memory Match Game not only a fun challenge but also an enjoyable way to sharpen their memory skills.
